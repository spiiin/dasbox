# dasbox-smfl

Dasbox-sfml branch with breaking incapsulation of sfml backend. Original dasbox use in as backend, but hide it api for able to select [different backends](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox/issues/5). But for now -- sfml provide rich api for make [small samples](https://github.com/spiiin/dasbox_sfml/tree/main/samples/sfml_blending).

Dasbox used as framework (instead for sfml-window) -- live context and debugging ability, and sfml-grapics as simple render api.
This project also used custom submodules:
- https://github.com/spiiin/daScript/tree/dascript_dasbox_branch
- https://github.com/spiiin/dasSFML/tree/dasbox_sfml

## How to use

Run your application:

  `dasbox.exe <path_to_application_folder/file_name.das>`

Optional comand line arguments:

  `--dasbox-console - duplicate output to console ('--' is also acceptable)` \
  `--trust - allow access to any file on this computer` \
  `--disable-auto-upscale - disabling automatic zooming, by default the window will be zoomed in 2 times, if the window is 2.5 times less than the desktop resolution` \
  `--use-debug-trap - cause the native code debugger to break on script breakpoint` \
  `--disable-gc - disable garbage collection`

Once the application is running, all the sources ('file_name.das' and all the sources requested from it) will be checked for changes and automatically reloaded. \
The current directory will change to 'path_to_application_folder'. For security reasons access to parent directories from within the script will be forbidden.

**F5** or **Ctrl+R** - reload sources in the manual mode \
**Ctrl+F5** or **Ctrl+Alt+R** - hard reload, **ECS** will be reloaded too \
**Tab** - switch to the logging screen and back

In the log screen your application will be paused.

Controls in the log screen:

  **Up, Down, Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Down, PgUp, PgDown, Mouse Scroll** - scroll log \
  **Left Mouse Button** - text selection \
  **Ctrl+C** - copy to clipboard
